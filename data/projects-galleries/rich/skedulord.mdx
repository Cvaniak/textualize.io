Skedulord is a tool that automates scheduling and logging of cronjobs. It adds a retry mechanic,
simple logging configuration and like-able user interfaces to make cron just a bit more fun to work with.
It's mainly meant for Python users but it can also be used for other tools launched from the command line.
