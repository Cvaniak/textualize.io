title: "We've released Textual 0.2.0"

I'm happy to announce the release of [Textual 0.2.0](https://github.com/Textualize/textual). The headline feature of this version is CSS support, but frankly there are a lot more additional features and improvements than a _minor_ version might suggest. The following video demonstrates a few of those features:

</div>

We've been working in a Git branch since the beginning of the year because the CSS was such a significant change to Textual's architecture and we didn't want to leave the main version in a state of flux. Fortunately the API has reached point where we don't anticipate it changing significantly between updates.

The API stability means we finally have [documentation](https://textual.textualize.io/) which we are very proud of! We draw our inspiration from such projects as Django and FastAPI.

The documentation and Textual itself are still very much a work in progress, but stable enough that we encourage you to use it for your next TUI project. Let us know what you build!

## Thanks!

I'd like to thank the [Textualize team](https://www.textualize.io/about-us) for their efforts.

I'd also like to thank the beta testers who have helped us identify and fix issues in the last few weeks.
