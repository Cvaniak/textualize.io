After having mostly worked with PHP, JavaScript and ActionScript during the first 15 years of my career as a
Web developer, I started to use Python after having seen its modern features - type hints,
type checking with MyPy, automatic formatting with Black, pytest, Pipenv... üòç  
For the last few years I've been working almost exclusively with Python, TypeScript and Go.

I am looking forward to seeing the apps people will build with Textual
once we will have fully implemented and documented the CSS machinery and the base widgets!

Outside of work I can usually be found bouldering, or running in Holyrood Park or... at the pub üçª
