Hi, I'm Darren ðŸ‘‹ I've been programming for around 10 years, and have worked with a variety of technologies during that time. My current love is Python, which I've now created a few open source projects with. Outside of work play video games, create art (pencil and digital), and sometimes work on hobby coding projects!
