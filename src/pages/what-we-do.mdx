# What we do

At Textualize we love the terminal&mdash;and we're not alone.

As a piece of software, the terminal has the distinction of being pre-installed on every Apple, Linux, and Windows computer ever made. Far from a throwback to computing history, most developers work with the terminal on a daily basis. The only other piece of software that comes close to this level of engagement with developers is the web browser.

What drives us at Textualize is the realisation that the terminal has more in common with a web browser than it does any other piece of software. Many of us _live_ in the terminal for a large part of the day, because&mdash;like the browser&mdash;the terminal is a platform.

As ubiquitous as it is, there has been surprisingly little innovation for user interfaces within the terminal. Developers use the terminal to write software for other platforms, but historically the tools and applications we use to do it haven't focused on presenting visually appealing or readable output. This is why Will McGugan, our CEO / Founder, wrote the hugely popular [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) library for Python in 2020. It gave developers the tools to more fully use the capabilities of the terminal and has since spawned several clones for other languages.

While Rich has made a generation of command line applications easier to work with, there is another class of application which we want to focus on. A TUI (Text User Interface) is an application that runs fullscreen within the terminal. Such applications pre-date the desktop and the web, but never really went away. Developers are still building TUI applications using awkward decades old APIs that don't fully exploit the terminal's potential.

Our answer to this is [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual), a work-in-progress Open-source framework for building TUI applications with a modern and minimal Python API. Textual applications are as quick and responsive as the TUIs that preceded it, but can be built in a fraction of the time with much improved usability and visuals. By lowering the barriers to building such applications and enhancing their appeal, the TUI can become the de-facto solution for many interfaces needs.

As much as we love TUIs and the terminal as a platform in general, terminal apps are largely restricted to a technical audience. With the advances we are making, we want to make Textual apps accessible to a wider audience (including the general public). To make this possible we are building technology that can take a Textual application from the terminal and make it available within a web browser, where it can be shared with anyone via a URL.

Such web-facing TUI applications bring advantages over the many technologies developers currently use to build for the web platform. Even the most basic web application will likely require a team of cross-disciplinary professionals. Contrast that with a Textual app which can be built by a single developer with just Python skills&mdash;no web development experience necessary. Many web apps that took weeks or months to build with traditional web technologies could be built with Textual in days.

While rapid development is compelling in itself, Textual apps have a number of ongoing benefits. With an interface constructed from highly compressible text, opening a web-facing Textual app can be virtually instantaneous, and updates are just as quick&mdash;making them highly suitable for applications that require realtime updates. The technology we are building also makes the deployment story simpler. Developers can opt to self-host their applications on their own network behind corporate firewalls, or on single board computers. Or they can use our cloud service for easy scalability.

As excited as we are about this web service, our roots are in the Open-source community, and we don't intend to compromise on that. Rich, Textual, and many of our future projects will continue to be built in public, with an Open-source license.
